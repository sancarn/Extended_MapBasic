# MapBasic_Window_Extension
This is an Open Source project. We are developing a powerful extension for the MapBasic Window in Pitney Bowes' MapInfo. The extension will give users the ability to compile on demand from the MapBasic Window. Further extensions may include custom MapBasic functions to accomplish common tasks.
