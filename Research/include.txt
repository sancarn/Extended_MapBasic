3 Files ::

A.AHK: {
  #Include B.AHK
}

B.AHK {
  #Include C.AHK
}

C.AHK {
  msgbox, hello you!
}

When running A.AHK, msgbox appears with "hello you!", as expected.

A.AHK: {

  #Include B.AHK
  msgbox, hello all!
}

B.AHK {
  #Include C.AHK
}

C.AHK {
  msgbox, hello you!
}

When running A.AHK > {
  msgbox appears with text "hello me!"
  msgbox appears with text "hello you!"
  msgbox appears with text "hello all!"
}

From this we can assume that in AHK, #Include ... essentially implies "execute code of ... and store its functions in memory"

This implies that we can create a header file: Header.AHK
We can include this header in our MAIN routine.
The header will then include all other scripts in the document.

It might also be nice to have a "transpile.ahk" which #Include's all .EMB transpiling scripts. However this would ensure all transpile options are enabled by default, which is something we may like to avoid.
